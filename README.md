# ezOAuthjs
Library for integrating secure and easy server side OAuth authentication in Android and (hopefully) IOS applications

#DISCLAIMER
This is my first proper project and I'm developing it as part of a bigger one (so don't expect perfect code), I'll add features when my main project needs them for now, but feel free to tinker with it and if you develop a feature I'll gladly take a look at it and add it in.
Constructive criticism is very appreciated :)

#Why?
The objective of this project is not putting the consumer keys and secrets for the different OAuth apis in the apk because I feel like it is too much of a security hole.
